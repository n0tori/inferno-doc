# Inferno.doc
This is a personal study resource for Dante's Inferno, including three English translations with some sentence highlighting, a summary, themes, references, and characters found in each canto.

The literary analysis, commentary, design, and all code for this educational resource are my own original work, though there may include some minor errors or omissions that I overlooked. The project took < a week including re-reading. The foundational English translations are properly attributed to their respective authors.

Highlighting limited to only cantos 1 & 2, unfortunately being one of the more tedious and boring tasks of the project. Feel free to contribute if you feel like wasting some time :)

The comparative format of this project was inspired by the approach taken by: https://www.danteinferno.info/translations/index.html
